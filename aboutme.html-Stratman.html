    <p class="p">I was born in Berkeley, California. Although, I grew up in Oakland. I attended school there for a few years until I moved to Piedmont. I attended Wildwood Elementary School, and from then on, I've been inside PUSD. <br>I also love playing soccer. I have been playing soccer since I was 5. I enjoy the sport a lot, and it brings me a lot of joy. <br>Another fun fact is that I'm in a rock band. Ever since the 3rd grade, with a few changes here and there. And most definitely a lot of improvement. <br>I enjoy the little things in life.</p>
